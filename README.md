# CubeConverter
A library for reading and converting minecraft model for Java/Bedrock edition.

### Basic example
- Not now.

### Offset to correct position
- If you put the model on item display it can be in the wrong position, you can fix this by add extra (scale * 0.5F) to the y position. That should do the trick.

Feel free to write a wiki for this project if you want (~~**PLEASE.**~~)

## Useful resources
CubeConverter would not have been possible without the following projects:
- [Blockbench](https://github.com/JannisX11/blockbench/): Used for debugging/testing models, helped with figure out converting, **DIRECT CODE IMPLEMENT FOR** [UV MAPPING](https://github.com/Oryxel/CubeConverter/blob/main/src/main/java/org/oryxel/cube/util/UVUtil.java).
